# XOR_Music_Mixer
Blend the Beat. Mix with XOR. XOR is a lightweight, AI-assisted music mixer that allows users to upload two audio tracks and intelligently combine them into one. With a futuristic UI and powerful backend logic, XOR is the first step toward creative, automated sound engineering.

## 🌐 Overview

XOR is a web-based tool that empowers users to:
- Upload two audio tracks
- Automatically blend them using FFmpeg
- Apply intelligent mixing rules using AI (future phase)
- Download the generated mix

This project serves as an MVP for what will evolve into a full-featured AI-powered music generation and blending app.

## ✨ Features

✅ Modern responsive front-end (TailwindCSS)  
✅ Stylized UI with glowing neon "X" brand  
✅ Upload two audio files and merge them  
✅ Node.js backend with `fluent-ffmpeg` audio mixing  
✅ Output preview & download  
🧠 Future-ready for AI logic via ChatGPT/Spleeter integration

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone or download the project

    git clone https://github.com/yourname/xor-ai-music-mixer.git
    cd xor-ai-music-mixer

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

    cd server
    npm install express multer cors fluent-ffmpeg uuid

### 3. Run Backend Server

    node app.js

## 🧪 Usage

- Open the app in a browser (index.html)
- Upload two .mp3 or .wav files
- Optionally choose a music style (future enhancement)
- Click “MIX TRACKS”
- Preview or download the mixed output
